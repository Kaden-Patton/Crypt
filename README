Block & Stream cipher encryption/decryption program.

Build:
    Make sure that both the Makefile and all .cpp and .h files are in the same directory. Open a terminal on a machine with make and the g++ compiler and run "make" to build the project. The output program is named "cipher"

Usage:

./cipher <BS> <input_file> <output_file> <key_file> <E|D>
    * This program requires a 16-byte (128 bit) key

Arguments:

    <B|S>:
        B: Block mode, program will perform read operations in 16-byte blocks
        S: Stream mode, program will perform read operations one byte at a time
    
    input_file:
        Filename of the output file
    
    output_file:
        Filename of the output file (!!CAUTION!! The program will overwrite any files of the same name)
    
    key_file:
        Filename of the file that contains the key
    
    <E|D>:
        E: Encrypt mode, program will encrypt input with the provided key and output the encrypted file.
        D: Decrypt mode, program will decrypt input with the provided key and output the decrypted file.
